- Queue processing with Redis and BullMQ
- Retry mechanism for failed jobs
- Support for Email, SMS, and In-App notifications

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Redis (via Redis Cloud)
- BullMQ (Queue library)
- ioredis (Redis client)

---

## ðŸ”§ Setup

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/notification-service.git
cd notification-service
npm install
````

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/notifications
REDIS_URL=redis://default:<password>@<host>:<port>
```

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Start the Worker (in another terminal)

```bash
node workers/notificationWorker.js
```

---

## ðŸ“® API Endpoints

### POST `/notifications`

**Send a notification**

```json
{
  "userId": "u123",
  "type": "email",
  "message": "Hello!"
}
```

* `type`: one of `email`, `sms`, `in-app`

### GET `/users/:id/notifications`

Get all notifications for a user (sorted by time)

### GET `/notifications/jobs`

Get job status of queued/completed/failed jobs

---

## âœ… Assumptions

* Actual delivery (email/sms) is not implemented â€” focus is on API + queue + persistence
* Retry is simulated using BullMQ's `attempts` and `backoff`
